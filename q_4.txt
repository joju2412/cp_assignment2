In the program 3 symbolic constants are intialized CONTINUE 1 WON 2 LOST 3.
In the program using rand() function 2 numbers are generated. Using 
dice1=1+rand()%6 one value is generated and similarly dice2 is also generated 
Sum of dice1 and dice2 are found and that value is passed to a switch statement 
If the value of sum is 11 case 11 is executed and gameStatus=WON If sum is 12
case 12 is executed and gameStatus=LOST. If value of sum is not matching with case then
Default case us executed where gameStatus=continue and mypoint=sum. Then there is while 
loop while(CONTINUE==gameStatus) This loop works only if default case was executed 
In the loop dice1 and dice2 are generated as shown in the beginning and their sum is found then there is an if statement 
if(sum==mypoint) then gameStatus=WON In the else part the sum is checked if(sum==7)
gameStatus=LOST.If the  if else statement doesn't run at least once then the loop will
run again since condition inside while loop remains true. At last if(WON==gameStatus) 
The player wins else the player looses
